  In environments with widely fluctuating physical conditions, natural selection
  seems to produce animals that are well-rounded generalists that are not
  specialised to a particular niche. This is because such environments in
  consideration fluctuate more in a year than over long timescales, which favours
  those animals that can do reasonably well under the varying conditions over
  those that are specialised to particular niches.
